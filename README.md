# SyrinscapeDiscordBot


This is a very early version of a bot that will interface with the Syrinscape Online Beta to stream the audio to Discord. Right now, it only establishes the websocket connected and received messages with .ogg data -- still working out whether there is an audio websocket stream or if we need to mix the audio ourselves.
